/**
   @brief Labels flat, sill and presill pixels in the provided DEM

   @details
   A flat pixel is one surrounded by pixels with the same or higher
   elevations. A sill pixel has the same elevation as a neighboring
   flat pixel but borders a pixel with a lower elevation. A presill
   pixel is a flat pixel that borders a sill pixel.

   The pixels are labeled with a bit field:

   - Bit 0: Set if pixel is a flat
   - Bit 1: Set if pixel is a sill
   - Bit 2: Set if pixel is a presill

   Since all presill pixels are also flats, bits 0 and 2 are both set
   for presill pixels. In other words presill pixels have a value of 5
   in the output array. This allows one to test the identity of pixels
   with bitwise operations:

   ```
   if (output[pixel] & 1) {
     // Pixel is a flat
   }
   if (output[pixel] & 2) {
     // Pixel is a sill

   @brief Compute costs for the gray-weighted distance transform

   @details
   The costs used to route flow over flat regions with the
   gray-weighted distance transform are based on the difference between

   This function identifies the connected components of flat pixels,

   @brief Compute excess topography with 2D varying threshold slopes
   using the fast sweeping method

   @details
   The excess topography (Blöthe et al. 2015) is computed by solving an
   eikonal equation (Anand et al. 2023) constrained to lie below the
   original DEM. Where the slope of the DEM is greater than the
   threshold slope, the eikonal solver limits the output topography to
   that slope, but where the slope of the DEM is lower that the
   threshold slope, the output follows the DEM.

   The eikonal equation is solved using the fast sweeping method (Zhao
   2004), which iterates over the DEM in alternating directions and
   updates the topography according to an upwind discretization of the
   gradient. To constrain the solution by the original DEM, the
   output topography is initiated with the DEM and only updates lower than the
   DEM are accepted.

   The fast sweeping method is simpler than the fast marching method
   (excesstopography_fmm2d()), requires less memory, and can be faster,
   particularly when the threshold slopes are constant or change
   infrequently across the domain.

/**
   @brief Compute excess topography with three-dimensionally variable
   lithology using the fast marching method

   @details
   The excess topography is computed by solving an eikonal equation with
   the fast marching method (see excesstopography_fmm2d() for more
   information). The threshold slope at a grid cell is computed from
   that cell's position within the three-dimensional lithology.

   The lithology consists of a set of discrete layers, each of which has
   its own threshold slope, which is specified by the caller in the
   `threshold_slopes` array from the bottom layer to the top layer. The
   layer geometry is provided by the caller in the `lithstack` array,
   which holds the elevation of the top surface of each layer at each
   grid cell.

   The algorithm proceeds similarly to the regular fast marching method,
   using a priority queue to update grid cells from bottom to
   top. Whenever a cell is updated, the eikonal solver is used to
   propose a new elevation using the threshold slopes from each layer
   from bottom to top. The first elevation that is proposed that lies
   below the top surface of the layer whose slope is used in the
   proposal is accepted as the provisional height for that grid cell.
