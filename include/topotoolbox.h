   @brief Labels flat, sill and presill pixels in the provided DEM

   A flat pixel is one surrounded by pixels with the same or higher
   elevations. A sill pixel has the same elevation as a neighboring
   flat pixel but borders a pixel with a lower elevation. A presill
   pixel is a flat pixel that borders a sill pixel.

   The pixels are labeled with a bit field:

   - Bit 0: Set if pixel is a flat
   - Bit 1: Set if pixel is a sill
   - Bit 2: Set if pixel is a presill

   Since all presill pixels are also flats, bits 0 and 2 are both set
   for presill pixels. In other words presill pixels have a value of 5
   in the output array. This allows one to test the identity of pixels
   with bitwise operations:

   ```
   if (output[pixel] & 1) {
     // Pixel is a flat
   }
   if (output[pixel] & 2) {
     // Pixel is a sill
   }

   }

 @brief Compute excess topography with 2D varying threshold slopes
 using the fast sweeping method

 The excess topography (Blöthe et al. 2015) is computed by solving an
 eikonal equation (Anand et al. 2023) constrained to lie below the
 original DEM. Where the slope of the DEM is greater than the
 threshold slope, the eikonal solver limits the output topography to
 that slope, but where the slope of the DEM is lower that the
 threshold slope, the output follows the DEM.

 The eikonal equation is solved using the fast sweeping method (Zhao
 2004), which iterates over the DEM in alternating directions and
 updates the topography according to an upwind discretization of the
 gradient. To constrain the solution by the original DEM, the
 output topography is initiated with the DEM and only updates lower than the
 DEM are accepted.

 The fast sweeping method is simpler than the fast marching method
 (excesstopography_fmm2d()), requires less memory, and can be faster,
 particularly when the threshold slopes are constant or change
 infrequently across the domain.

 The fast marching method is more complicated than the fast sweeping
 method (excesstopography_fmm2d()) and requires pre-allocated memory
 for the priority queue. It is faster than the fast sweeping method
 when the threshold slopes change frequently.

/**
 @brief Compute excess topography with three-dimensionally variable
 lithology using the fast marching method

 The excess topography is computed by solving an eikonal equation with
 the fast marching method (see excesstopography_fmm2d() for more
 information). The threshold slope at a grid cell is computed from
 that cell's position within the three-dimensional lithology.

 The lithology consists of a set of discrete layers, each of which has
 its own threshold slope, which is specified by the caller in the
 `threshold_slopes` array from the bottom layer to the top layer. The
 layer geometry is provided by the caller in the `lithstack` array,
 which holds the elevation of the top surface of each layer at each
 grid cell.

 The algorithm proceeds similarly to the regular fast marching method,
 using a priority queue to update grid cells from bottom to
 top. Whenever a cell is updated, the eikonal solver is used to
 propose a new elevation using the threshold slopes from each layer
 from bottom to top. The first elevation that is proposed that lies
 below the top surface of the layer whose slope is used in the
 proposal is accepted as the provisional height for that grid cell.

                              the top surface of the given layer. Note that the
                              first dimension is the layer, so that the layers
