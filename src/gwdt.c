// Gray-weighted distance transforms for auxiliary topography

/*
  # Cost computation

  The costs for the gray-weighted distance transform are given by

  cost[i,j] = (maxdepth - (filled_dem[i,j] - original_dem[i,j]))^tweight +
  CarveMinVal;

  where maxdepth is the maximum difference between the filled and
  original DEMs over the connected component of flat pixels to which
  the (i,j) pixel belongs.

  Computing the maximum depth is done with a connected components
  labeling algorithm by Wu et al. (2009) and described by He et
  al. (2017) and related to the Hoshen-Kopelman algorithm (1976). This
  algorithm takes two passes over the data. In the first pass, each
  flat pixel is assigned a provisional label. The labels of
  neighboring flat pixels are considered /equivalent/ because they
  belong to the same connected component. An /equivalence class/ is a
  set of equivalent labels that are all equivalent to each
  other. During the first pass, the algorithm builds a union-find data
  structure that identifies which equivalence class each pixel belongs
  to. This data structure is described below. The second pass resolves
  equivalent labels to a unique label per connected component, with
  that label determined by the pixel with the highest difference
  between filled and original DEMs. A third pass over the data
  computes the costs using the maximum depth for each connected
  component.

  # Union-find implementation

  Equivalence classes of labels are recorded in a union-find data
  structure. To avoid allocating additional memory for this data
  structure, it is built into the return values of the `compute_costs`
  function, namely a ptrdiff_t array of size (dims[0],dims[1]), which
  holds labels for the connected components, and a float array of the
  same size. The float array ultimately holds the costs returned from
  the function, but during the algorithm, it is used to keep track
  of the maximum depth over each connected component.

  The union-find data structure uses linear indices of pixels as
  labels of the connected components. A pixel in the labels array
  points to another pixel in its equivalence class. If it points to
  itself, it is called the /root/ of that equivalence class. While
  scanning through the DEM the first time, the algorithm inserts
  pixels into the union-find data structure by making them the root of
  their own equivalence class. It then /unifies/ the labels of
  neighboring flat pixels by making them point to the same root. The
  new root of two neighboring pixels is chosen so that it has the
  greatest DEM difference of the flat pixels in its equivalence
  class. The first pass determines the correct equivalence classes of
  each flat pixel. Every chain of labels eventually leads to a root
  pixel with the greatest DEM difference in its connected
  components. However, different pixels in the same connected
  component may still be labeled with different labels. A second pass
  is required to label each pixel with the root of its equivalence
  class and the corresponding maximum DEM difference.
